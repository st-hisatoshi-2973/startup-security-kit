# Startup Security Kit

Security starter kit for startups and small teams.

This repository provides practical security guidance that small teams can realistically adopt.

Many security frameworks are designed for large enterprises and are too heavy for startups.
Startup Security Kit focuses on **lightweight and practical security practices**.

# Features

This project includes three core components:

### ISMS Lite

A lightweight ISMS implementation designed for small teams.

Includes:

* security policy template
* asset register
* risk assessment template
* incident response guide
* internal audit guide

---

### PDCA Cycle

ISMS Lite follows a simplified PDCA cycle.

* Plan — define security policies and perform risk assessments
* Do — implement security controls and operational procedures
* Check — verify implementation through internal audits
* Act — improve security processes based on findings

This cycle enables small teams to continuously improve their security practices.

### Developer Security Checklist

A practical checklist for developers when designing or reviewing systems.

Topics include:

* authentication
* authorization
* API security
* secrets management
* logging and monitoring

---

### Secure Backend Patterns

Security architecture patterns for backend systems.

Examples include:

* JWT authentication design
* RBAC authorization
* secure API design
* audit logging
* secret management

# Target Audience

This project is designed for:

* startups
* small companies (1–10 people)
* developer-led teams
* backend engineers

Many small teams do not have dedicated security engineers.
This project provides practical security guidance for such environments.

# Quick Start

1. Copy the security policy template
2. Create your asset register
3. Run a risk assessment
4. Apply the developer security checklist

This provides a basic security foundation for small teams.

# Why This Project Exists

Most security frameworks target large enterprises.

However, startups and small teams face different challenges:

* limited resources
* small engineering teams
* lack of security specialists

Startup Security Kit provides **practical security guidance designed for small teams.**
